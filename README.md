# Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition ELO Histogram (1v1 Random Map)

* Data from aoe2.net API (https://aoe2.net/#api)
* Chart by Google Charts (https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/histogram)
* Static site generated by next.js (https://nextjs.org/)
* Hosted on Github pages (https://pages.github.com/)

# Dev

`npm install`
`npm run dev`

# Deployment

Generate static site

`npm run build && npm run export`

The site is exported to `/out`.

Delete the exisiting gh-pages branch and push the contents of the ./out directory to a new gh-pages branch
`git push origin :gh-pages && git subtree push --prefix out origin gh-pages`

# Testing the production build

To make this work, you'll have to replace the references to "aoe2-de-elo-histogram" in env-config.js and next.config.js with "" (blank)

After that, you can see the production static app using a webserver.

For example:
1. Install serve globally, you only need to do this once `npm install -g serve`
1. Navigate the the site's root directory `cd ./out`
1. Serve the site `serve -p 8080`
1. Visit `localhost:8080` in your browser
